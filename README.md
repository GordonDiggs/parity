Parity
======

Shell commands for development, staging, and production parity for Heroku apps.

Install
-------

    gem install parity

This installs three shell commands:

    development
    staging
    production

Your development machine will also need these command-line programs:

    curl
    hk
    pg_restore

On a Mac, `curl` is installed by default.

Install `hk`:

    L=/usr/local/bin/hk && curl -sL -A "`uname -sp`" https://hk.heroku.com/hk.gz | zcat >$L && chmod +x $L

Install `pg_restore`:

    brew install postgres --no-python

Usage
-----

Backup a database:

    production backup
    staging backup

Restore a production or staging database backup into development:

    development restore production
    development restore staging

Restore a production database backup into staging:

    staging restore production

Open a console:

    production console
    staging console

Open [log2viz][1]:

    production log2viz
    staging log2viz

Migrate a database and restart the dynos:

    production migrate
    staging migrate

Tail a log:

    production tail
    staging tail

The scripts also pass through, so you can do anything with them that you can do
with `hk ______ -a staging` or `hk ______ -a production` where `staging` and
`production` are git remotes:

    watch production ps
    staging open

Convention
----------

Parity expects:

* A `staging` remote pointing to the staging Heroku app.
* A `production` remote pointing to the production Heroku app.
* There is a `config/database.yml` file that can be parsed as Yaml for
  `['development']['database']`.
* The Heroku apps are named like `app-staging` and `app-production`
  where `app` is equal to `basename $PWD`.

Configuration
-------------

Override some of the conventions:

```ruby
Parity.configure do |config|
  config.database_config_path = 'different/path.yml'
  config.heroku_app_basename = 'different-base-name'
end
```
